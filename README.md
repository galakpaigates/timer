# Timer

### This is a Countdown Timer built by 'galakpaigates' to keep Count.
### You can Input the Minute and Second you want to count and when it is done, there will be a beep.
### This Project was inspired by Prayer. I was doing a condition and wanted to pray for 12 Minutes, but I didn't have any timer so I decided to build one, and I did it.
